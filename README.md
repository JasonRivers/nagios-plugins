nagios-plugins
==============

Nagios plugins written by me for work.

## check_asterisk_ami ##

This plugin will monitor the number of calls, channels, SIP peers & IAX2 peers

## check_snmp_printer ##

This plugin will tell you toner/drum levels for printers over SNMP, currently it's assumed anything that isn't a Cannon or a HP are in CMYK (Cannon/HP seem to be in KCMY).



More plugins will appear as I write them, and some can't be made public due to the devices they talk to.
